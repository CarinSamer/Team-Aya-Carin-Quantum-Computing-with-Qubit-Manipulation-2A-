Explore basic concepts of quantum computing through qubit manipulation and get familiar with how does query model and circuit model of quantum computation work. 

From simple wooden devices to digital electronic computers to supercomputers, physics and computation have always been intertwined. This is due to the fact of using physical systems in encoding information and processing them. Quantum computing is a research area that extends the set of physical laws classical computers operate on by accessing the quantum aspects of a physical world, opening up new ways for processing information. 

The ability to simulate and compute is enhanced by increasing the number of transistors, as their number directly affects processing and accuracy capability. According to Moore's Law, the maximum number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. As soon as it doubles, computer performance increases. However, there's a theoretical limit to the miniaturization of computing components. We can't make a transistor smaller than an atom! This is where quantum computing comes into play. 

When Richard Feynman first proposed the notion of a quantum computer in 1982, his focus was on simulating quantum mechanical systems. To the best of our understanding, nature is not classical â€” it's quantum. And so, quantum computers may prove to be valuable tools for understanding it.

In this repo you will find the Google Colab notebook including the conducted experiments using Qiskit and Pennylane and the research paper itself.
